# YourStagmontASA

`YourStagmontASA` is a Telegram bot for Stagmont's [Camp Companion](https://i-zone.mobi/Companion/). Powered by [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify), and a few button presses, `YourStagmontASA` aims to be a simpler, faster and secure alternative to marking parade states. Why spend two minutes marking parade states when you can do it in a mere twenty seconds?

## Setup
